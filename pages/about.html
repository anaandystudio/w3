      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h2>Intersecting Engineering, modern manufacturing and traditional materials </h2>
      <p>AnaAndy_Studio is a research-driven design studio exploring innovative approaches to traditional materials. With a foundation in both scientific research and material craft, our work bridges the worlds of design, experimentation, and material science.

Founded by Ana Yagüe Relimpio and Andreas Fink, who bring a background in Synthetic Biology and Computational Chemistry, the studio investigates how age-old materials—like clay, stone, wood and metal — can be transformed through modern techniques and cross-disciplinary thinking.

Our process is rooted in curiosity and rigor. We combine simulation, and computer design with hands-on making, exploring the interplay of form and utility. This hybrid approach allows us to prototype new objects and design objects that are as informed by research as they are by intuition.

While ceramics remain currently core part of our practice, we investigate the usage of various materials as living systems—shaped by time, touch, and transformation. From experimental sculptures to everyday objects, our work seeks to question, reframe, and evolve material traditions and uses.

AnaAndy_Studio is a space where science meets design, and where innovation is grounded in the physicality of making. We create with intention, question convention, and aim to expand the possibilities of what materials can be—and do. </p1>
